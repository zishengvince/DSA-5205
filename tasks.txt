Selection of the optimal parameters is challenging for machine learning, so our project try to use genetic algorithm to select stocks and allocate weights.


We use a binary string as the unit gene:
    5-bit binary string to represent the weight of one stock;
    100 stocks, so the gene length is 500 for an unit, which represents the weights of the 100 stocks.

Run genetic algorithm shown on the left to get the best unit:
    Best unit has the weights for the 100 stocks;
    Select 10 out of 100 stocks with biggest weights to construct the portfolio;
    Filter out those with negative expected return stocks from the 10 stocks to construct the final portfolio;
    The final portfolio in this case may have less than 10 stocks.

LSTM + Genetic Algorithm
    Use LSTM model to predict the close price of NASDAQ100 underlying stocks in October;
    Pass the predicted price and return into genetic algorithm to get the component stocks and then calculate the weight of each stock;
    Use the real price and return of October to evaluate the performance of the above portfolio.

SVM + Markowitz efficient frontier
    Use historical known price and other fundamental information to predict the probability of going up for each stock;
    Choose 10 stocks with highest probability and then pass these 10 stocks into efficient frontier algorithm;
    Use historical known price and return of these 10 stocks as well as the efficient frontier model to get the weight of each stock;
    Use the real price and return of October to evaluate the performance of the above portfolio.
